## Dataset Content
* Dataset shows the value both in local currency and USD of different industries from various countries around the world. The data begins in 2000 and goes up to 2021. Not every country has data in every year, so the user will need to consider this when making decisions.

## Business Requirements
* The user profile is an established investment firm, looking to invest in a new industry. They want a dashboard that allows them to see how the industries have developed over the years so they can make informed decisions when choosing the one to invest into. The user is a global magnate so is willing to invest around the world, but is orginally from Europe/UK, so their primary interest would be to invest in there if it's financially feasible.  


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* Investment Opportunities:
* *  Which manufacturing sectors offer the most promising investment opportunities?
* *   What are the risks and returns associated with investing in different manufacturing industries?
* * Which countries are experiencing growth in manufacturing sectors that would make them good places to invest.

Economic Growth and Development:

* Which manufacturing sectors have experienced the most significant growth in specific countries or regions?
* How has the value of manufacturing output changed over time, and what are the underlying drivers?
* What is the contribution of manufacturing to overall economic growth?
* How does the value of different manufacturing sectors compare between countries.

The questions will be validated by providing clear graphs and KPI's which show at which rate the industries are growing, the growth per country, and comparion graphs between the different countries. 

## Project Plan
* After loading and cleaning the dataset, columns and data will be adjusted to make it easier to read and perform analysis on. 
* Data is collected through the IEA website which works with governments and industries to shape a secure and sustainable energy future. The data is readily available and free to access. 

The research methodologies were chosen based on the specific requirements and goals of the project. The primary objective was to provide actionable insights for a multimillionaire investor looking to invest in new industries. The methodologies were selected to ensure comprehensive, accurate, and relevant analysis. Here are the key reasons for choosing the methodologies:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - **Purpose:** To summarize and describe the main features of the dataset.
   - **Reason:** Descriptive statistics provide a clear overview of the data, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range). This helps in understanding the general trends and patterns in the data.

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** To analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals.
   - **Reason:** Time series analysis is essential for identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical behavior in the data over time. This is crucial for understanding how industries have developed and predicting future trends.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** To compare different groups or categories within the dataset.
   - **Reason:** Comparative analysis allows for the evaluation of different industries and countries, highlighting the most promising investment opportunities and identifying areas of growth.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Purpose:** To represent data graphically.
   - **Reason:** Visualizations such as graphs, charts, and dashboards make complex data more accessible and understandable. They help in communicating insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

5. **Machine Learning Techniques (if applicable):**
   - **Purpose:** To build predictive models and uncover hidden patterns.
   - **Reason:** Machine learning techniques can enhance the analysis by providing more accurate predictions and identifying relationships that may not be apparent through traditional methods.

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Purpose:** To analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
   - **Reason:** EDA helps in uncovering initial insights, detecting anomalies, and testing hypotheses. It is a crucial step in understanding the data before applying more complex analytical techniques.

### Justification for Methodologies

The chosen methodologies align with the project's goals of providing clear, actionable insights for investment decisions. They ensure a thorough analysis of the data, considering both historical trends and future projections. By combining descriptive statistics, time series analysis, comparative analysis, and data visualization, the project delivers a comprehensive view of the data, supporting informed decision-making.

Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques (if applicable) and exploratory data analysis further enhances the robustness and depth of the analysis, ensuring that the insights are both accurate and relevant to the user's needs.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
