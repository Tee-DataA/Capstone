# Capstone Project

# ![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)


Welcome to my captsone project! I decided to see which countries are emerging in the manufacturing industry. I chose this because the data was available and I found it intruiging. It was very important to me that I used real data as this gives a sense of Authethenticity and relevance to the analysis, ensuring that the insights and conclusions drawn are grounded in actual industry trends and economics.

## Dataset Content
* Dataset shows the value both in local currency and USD of different industries from various countries around the world. The data begins in 2000 and goes up to 2021. Initial scan of the database show that not every country has data in every year, so the exported csv files will be adjusted to take 2018 at the latest as this has the most significant data. I will also be using GDP data from the Worldbank website to help support my analysis as the features in my main dataset aren't enough to draw conclusions on their own.

## Project Plan
* After loading and cleaning the dataset, columns and data will be adjusted to make it easier to read and perform analysis on. 
* Data is collected through the IEA website which works with governments and industries to shape a secure and sustainable energy future. The data is readily available and free to access. Datais also collected from the worldbank website.

The research methodologies were chosen based on the specific requirements and goals of the project. The primary objective was to provide actionable insights for the user looking to invest in new industries. The methodologies were selected to ensure comprehensive, accurate, and relevant analysis. Here are the key reasons for choosing the methodologies:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - **Purpose:** To summarize and describe the main features of the dataset.
   - **Reason:** Descriptive statistics provide a clear overview of the data, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range). This helps in understanding the general trends and patterns in the data.

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** To analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals.
   - **Reason:** Time series analysis is essential for identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical behavior in the data over time. This is crucial for understanding how industries have developed and predicting future trends.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** To compare different groups or categories within the dataset.
   - **Reason:** Comparative analysis allows for the evaluation of different industries and countries, highlighting the most promising investment opportunities and identifying areas of growth.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Purpose:** To represent data graphically.
   - **Reason:** Visualizations such as graphs, charts, and dashboards make complex data more accessible and understandable. They help in communicating insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Purpose:** To analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
   - **Reason:** EDA helps in uncovering initial insights, detecting anomalies, and testing hypotheses. It is a crucial step in understanding the data before applying more complex analytical techniques.

### Justification for Methodologies
